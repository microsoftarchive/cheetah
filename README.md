# cheetah

Command line interface for MSSQL that works in OSX and Linux. It also supports [Azure SQL Data Warehouse](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-data-warehouse/). The package was heavily inspired by [psql](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/app-psql.html) (PostgreSQL), [sql-cli](https://github.com/hasankhan/sql-cli) and [sqlcmd](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms162773.aspx) (MSSQL).

The tool is **under development**, please use it with caution as it has no test coverage!

## Installation

You have to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) (at least 5.6+) to use this package. 

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/wunderlist/cheetah.git
$ cd cheetah
$ npm install -g
```

The package is not available via `npm` at the moment.

You can also define a few environment variable if you don't want to specify these attributes everytime.

```sh
export MSSQL_HOST='host'
export MSSQL_PORT='1433'
export MSSQL_DATABASE='database'
export MSSQL_USER='username'
export MSSQL_PASSWORD='password'
export MSSQL_ENCRYPT='true' # `true` for azure
``` 

### Executing files

You can execute files with the following commands:

```sh
$ cat query.sql | cheetah
$ cheetah query.sql
```

Do not forget, you have to use the `GO` command to specify the batches!

Furthermore, you can specify the debugging settings within the file if you want.

```sql
-- cheetah/timing ON
-- cheetah/verbose ON
```

### Interactive mode

You can start the interactive mode with the following command:

```sh
$ cheetah -I
```

It contains a few built-in commands inspired by `psql`.

```
Commands:
  \d 		Lists tables and views
  \dt 		Lists tables
  \dv 		Lists views
  \d TABLE 	Describes table schema
  \q 		Quit

Other commands:
  \u 		Updates available suggestions
```

You have to use the `GO` command when you want to execute your previous commands.

The package supports multi-line queries and copy-paste. Moreover it provides auto-complete like suggestions for tables and columns with the quoted form.
